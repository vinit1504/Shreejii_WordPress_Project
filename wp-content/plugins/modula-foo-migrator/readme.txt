Migrate away from FooGallery is the official migrator from FooGallery to Modula Gallery

== Description ==

Easily migrate your galleries from FooGallery to Modula, a customizable WordPress gallery plugin that’s responsive and doesn’t require any coding skills. We provide an importing tool that’s really great for moving your galleries to Modula without jumping through hoops.

== Why migrate from FooGallery to Modula? ==

While FooGallery provides more features based on templates, Modula allows you to fully control your galleries. So, if you want to create more galleries in different styles (various animations and effects), you might find yourself quite limited when using FooGallery.

Lucky for you, Modula provides a lot of customization options - 4 different grid types (creative, custom, slider, and masonry), 48 hover effects, animations, thumbnails, 4 image loading effects, filterable galleries, and a beautiful Lightbox powered by Facybox. But that’s not all. With Modula, you get a modern solution for your galleries that will impress your potential clients. 

Not all heroes wear capes, and not all plugins are a good fit for everyone. But Modula surely is. You also get album creation, video integration, custom links, captions, watermarking, right-click protection, password protection, EXIF integrations, pagination, user roles, social sharing buttons, enable downloading, and more! 

You get the picture: Modula helps you reach the sky! Let’s see some examples of galleries and portfolios that our community has built:

* Real Estate
* Adventure
* Travel
* Food
* Restaurants
* Interior and exterior design
* Commercial
* Lifestyle
* Art
* Centers, projects, and workshops presentations
* Weddings
* Events
* Illlustration and design
* Bands
* Boudoir
* Black and White
* Animals
* Macro
* Landscapes
* Portraits
* Motion
* Family
* Personal Branding
* Fashion
* And they never stop!


Amazing, right?! And these are only a few examples. You can build whatever your business needs with Modula. Moreover, we can offer you CSS codes and customization that we’ve been collecting for years. You can find everything you need in our documentation or contact our support team, which is always happy to help.

== Which parts of my FooGallery will automatically import to Modula? ==

Our Import tool migrates most features from the core FooGallery plugin. We import the following customization from FooGallery:

* Gallery title
* Image title
* Image caption
* Image alt text
* Image URL
* Target
* Grid type and settings associations between Modula and FooGallery
* Image size
* Gutter
* Lazy load

== Grid type ==

Depending on the grid type you use in FooGallery, we associate it with what we have. Here we also include the slider and single thumbnail view (max image count is set, and 1 single thumbnail appears). When clicking on the thumbnail, you can go through the whole gallery in the Lightbox.

== Shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks == 

We also replace your shortcodes or Gutenberg blocks from pages and posts (your FooGallery shortcodes will be changed to Modula shortcodes).
